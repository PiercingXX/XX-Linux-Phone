# Notifications

The shell owns `org.freedesktop.Notifications` on the session bus
(`launcher/src/notif_daemon.py`, in-process daemon). When another daemon
(dunst, mako, fnott) already owns the name, the shell backs off and the
shade reads through its fallback subscription path instead.

Capabilities advertised: `body`, `body-markup`, `actions`, `persistence`.

Every `Notify` reaches the shade with its id, app name, summary, body,
desktop entry, raw hints dict, and decoded `[(key, label), ...]` action
pairs. Tapping an action emits `ActionInvoked` on the bus as usual; the
shade then dismisses the notification (resident rows stay).

## Muting

`muted_apps: {app_id: until_epoch}` in the shell config discards an
app's notifications for 1/2/4/8 hours (see "Disable for…" in
`../design.md`): no banner, no sound, nothing in the shade. Muting also
clears the app's live notifications (`NotificationClosed` reason 3, as if
the app closed them itself). The mute expires silently.

## Action targets: reaching an exited service

Some actions belong to a background service that has already exited by
the time the user taps: the dialer policy service posts Call back /
Message / Ring next time / Block on its missed-call cards and then
idle-exits,
and the TxxT daemon posts Reply / Open the same way. A plain
`ActionInvoked` signal would go nowhere, because signals do not
auto-start services.

Such a notification carries the hint `x-xx-wm-action-target` (string):

```
"<bus_name> <object_path> <interface>"
```

When the user invokes an action on a notification with a well-formed
hint, the shell emits `ActionInvoked` as usual **and** calls

```
<interface>.HandleNotificationAction(in u id, in s action_key)
```

on that target with auto-start allowed (async, 5 s timeout,
fire-and-forget, DEBUG log on failure), so the bus daemon starts the
service and it acts. A missing or malformed hint is ignored: the three
parts must be a well-formed bus name (well-known or unique),
object path, and interface, e.g.

```
x-xx-wm-action-target:
  "io.piercingxx.XXDialer.Policy /io/piercingxx/XXDialer/Policy io.piercingxx.XXDialer.Policy1"
```

with actions `call-back` / `ring-next-time` / `block-contact`, plus
`message` on missed-call cards (single cards for known callers carry
`call-back` / `message` / `block-contact`, adding `ring-next-time` for
unknown callers; grouped cards carry no actions). The
service implements `HandleNotificationAction` with the same `(u, s)`
signature and dispatches on the action key it posted.

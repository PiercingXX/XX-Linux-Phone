"""First-run Setup probes: real state, never cached guesses.

Each probe reads live system state on a worker thread (never the GTK
main loop) and reports ``(ok, detail)`` for one Setup row:

- xx-contacts reachable or at least D-Bus activatable,
- the policy service activatable (``ListActivatableNames`` — never a
  ``GetNameOwner`` gate, which reports an activatable-but-idle service
  as absent and would keep it dead; see ``docs/shell-consult.md``),
- ModemManager present with a Voice-capable modem,
- the shell consulting us (screen rows the shell's ``CheckNumber``
  wrote, per ``docs/shell-consult.md``),
- a notification server reachable, plus a test-ring sender.

Pure mappers take fetched data so headless tests drive them without a
bus; the ``real_*`` fetchers do the Gio calls. All Gio imports stay
inside functions so this module loads without gi.
